# A useful ESP32 Bluetooth debug tool

This is a useful ESP32 BLE tool. You can use this app to scan BLE device 
around you and then view services, characteristics, and descriptors provided 
by the BLE device. Plus, you can use it as a client to connect to ESP32 
via Bluetooth, and controll the LED on DOIT ESP32 board.

To test connection with ESP32 you have to build the following example:

The following video is a test with ESP32: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhvA33yf7P8
